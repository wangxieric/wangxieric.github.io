A Postdoctoral Researcher at University College London (UCL) with research interests on conversational AI, natural language processing, information retrieval and recommendation systems. Current research project is focusing on "task-oriented dialogue systems" under supervision of [Professor Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home). I obtained my PhD from University of Glasgow, supervised by [Prof. Iadh Ounis](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/) and [Prof. Craig Macdonald](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/), with thesis entitled “A framework for leveraging properties of user reviews in recommendation”, which explores the review-based recommendation task and introduced a framework for modeling the personal usefulness of reviews based on their various properties, and for making personalized recommendations based on learned user preferences.
