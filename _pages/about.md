A lecturer (~Assistant Professor) of Natural Language Processing at The University of Sheffield (TUoS) with research interests in Interactive NLP, Conversational AI, and personalisation as well as relevant topics among Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). Before joining the University of Sheffield, I obtained my PhD from the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Prof. Iadh Ounis](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/) and [Prof. Craig Macdonald](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) and focusing on the research topic of developing review-based recommender systems. After that, I joined the web intelligence group of University College London (UCL) as a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home) and working on Task-oriented Dialogue Systems. My existing works have been published in top-tier international NLP and IR conferences, including ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, SIGIR, CIKM, WWW and ECIR. During the postdoctoral research period, joined with [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home), a research grant was awarded by Google for developing Knowledge-enriched task-oriented dialogue systems.

I am actively looking for PhD students to work on topics related to proactive conversational information seeking, retrieval augmented generation and user simulation. If you are interested, please drop an email to xi.wang[at]sheffield.ac.uk with the subject starts with [PhD 2026].
