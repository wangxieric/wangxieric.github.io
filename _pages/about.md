A lecturer (~Assistant Processor) of Natural Language Processing at The University of Sheffield (TUoS) with research interests in Conversational AI, personalisation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Fairness as well as relevant topics among Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). Before joining the University of Sheffield, I obtained my PhD from the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Prof. Iadh Ounis](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/) and [Prof. Craig Macdonald](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) and focusing on the research topic of developing review-based recommender systems. After that, I joined the web intelligence group of University College London (UCL) as a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home) and working on Task-oriented Dialogue Systems. My existing works have been published in top-tier international NLP and IR conferences, including ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, SIGIR, CIKM, WWW and ECIR. During the postdoctoral research period, joined with [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home), a research grant valued at $20,000 was awarded by Google for developing Knowledge-enriched task-oriented dialogue systems.
